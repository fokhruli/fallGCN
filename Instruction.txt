 - use stgcn model for training. change model output, loss optimizing based on given informations.
 - now add  biomechanical features with existing framework and train fusion models and calculate results.


what I understand:

In the context of the fall prediction algorithm, the output layer is responsible for predicting the probability of a 
fall occurring at each timestep. The time horizon mentioned, "up to 2 seconds ahead," refers to the algorithm's ability
to predict a potential fall before it actually happens.

Here's what it means:

1. The algorithm processes the pose data and biomechanical features using a sliding window approach, where each window represents
 a short segment of time (e.g., 3 seconds).

2. At each timestep (e.g., every 0.5 seconds), the algorithm predicts the probability of a fall occurring within the next 2 seconds
based on the current and previous data points.

3. For example, if the current timestep is at t=0, the algorithm predicts the fall probability for the next 2 seconds (t=0 to t=2). 
At the next timestep (t=0.5), it predicts the fall probability for t=0.5 to t=2.5, and so on.

4. The time horizon of 2 seconds means that the algorithm is designed to provide an early warning of a potential fall up to 2 seconds before it happens. 
This gives the system or caregiver a short window of time to take preventive measures or provide assistance.

5. The statement "ideally we want to increase" suggests that the goal is to extend the time horizon beyond 2 seconds in the future. A longer time horizon 
would provide more advanced warning and allow for earlier interventions. However, increasing the time horizon may also make the predictions less accurate, 
as it requires the algorithm to anticipate falls further into the future based on the available data.
